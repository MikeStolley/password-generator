# Password Generator Starter Code

<!-- Content -->
Hello! I have my code written out for the password generator 100% in JS, and in the attached folder. no code was added to the HTML or CSS, and window logs/confirms were utilized in javascript to perform my if statements and general functions

<!-- Javascript Additions -->
Initially, I attempted to use an array to store all of my variables to clean up my code, but wasn't successful. So i resorted to just listing them out individually At the top of the page, including the empty strings to store my final generated password. While I don't believe the password is actually coming out the way it should, I have it set up to confirm all of the required text, and generate an assortment of randomized characters, numbers, and special characters. to calculate the final results, I couldn't initially get anything other than one variable to display when using a Math.floor function, so I used charAt and a "+=" at the beginning to remedy the situation, despite not getting exact results for my math.
